## 🧐 After Month 1
- **Week 5**: Turbomachinery — Axial/radial stages, velocity triangles, efficiencies  
  ☑ Book: *Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer of Turbomachinery*

- **Week 6**: Material Resistance — Stress, strain, failure modes  
  ☑ Book suggestions to be confirmed

- **Week 7**: Combustion Theory & High-Speed Flow  
  ☑ Book: *Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics* (Anderson)  
  ☑ Begin focus on **supersonic combustion** and **aerobreathing engines** (SCRAMJET intro)

- **Week 8+**: Advanced Thermodynamics + Multiphysics Coupling  
  ☑ Bridging thermo with CFD/simulations and optimization techniques

Stay consistent. Note what you understand, log code + math in GitHub, and revisit difficult topics iteratively.
